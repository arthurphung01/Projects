# Final Project - TinyJAMBU implementation with FPGA using Verilog

### Submitted by Group H: Katherine M. Orozco, Ian Phelps, Arthur Phung

## Description
This final project was to implement the TinyJAMBU functions into a FPGA board using Verilog. This involves the use of UART, VGA, and 7-segment displays; however, we were unable
to construct a working verilog code that had all these implementations.
